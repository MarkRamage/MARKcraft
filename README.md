This is a minecraft clone written in C++, I am currently following the tutorials found on the following url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2E3-uceK9c&amp;index=1&amp;list=PLMZ_9w2XRxiZq1vfw1lrpCMRDufe2MKV_ 


I am doing this project to help me retain my skills in C++ during a code light semester at college. It will also allow me to learn how to code using openGL. After I complete the tutorial I hope to expand on its framework for future fun and coding practice.
